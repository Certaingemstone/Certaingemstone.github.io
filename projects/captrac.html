    <div id="box3">
        <p>In a certain Government class at my high school, the class is allowed to come up with the course policies.
        Naturally, we decided to opt for an incredibly convoluted (describing it took almost an entire page) and funny system for dealing with attendance, in which
        you would gain "stacks" for frequently being late or absent from class, which would accumulate and/or decay over time according to a set of rules.
        Upon gaining enough "stacks," you would be assigned to wear a paper dunce cap in class until they decayed back to zero.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone thought this was hilarious, so we pushed for it, only to be met with the teacher's complaints that it was all too complicated and therefore unenforceable.
        To address these demands, I put together a Python script that would run daily on my laptop, to keep track of the details while
        leaving taking attendance itself and entering it into a Google Sheets spreadsheet (yes, it's both the back and frontend) the only manual task.</p>
        <p>Now, the question you're probably asking: did anyone ever wear a dunce cap? I'll leave that as a mystery.</p>
