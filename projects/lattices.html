        <p>Crystals minimize energy. I wanted to see what structures arise, ab initio.

        <p>Suppose you're doing a take-home final exam in statistical physics. The last question is as follows:
        Consider a triangular lattice, i.e. the vertices in a plane tiled by equilateral triangles.
        Particles can occupy any lattice site, but there is an energy cost (e.g. electrostatic repulsion)
        to having particles in "adjacent" sites. Suppose 2 of 3 sites are occupied. What structure
        will the particles fall into, that minimizes the interaction energy?
        </p>
        <p>There's an analytical argument that can be made, which I eventually came up with, that
        the resulting structure is like a honeycomb on this lattice. However, I wanted to <i>see</i> that
        this was the case. I'd heard a year earlier about simulated annealing from a friend who was trying to
        do parameter optimization on a trebuchet, and thought that this situation would make for a very
        literal application. I cracked open my favorite text editor <i>(rest in peace, Atom)</i> for some hacky Python.
        </p>
        <p>The idea is pretty simple. From statistical mechanics, we know a system occupies states
        of different energies with relative probabilities determined by the corresponding Boltzmann factor.
        This Boltzmann factor depends on the thermodynamic temperature of the system and the state's energy.
        Higher energy states are exponentially suppressed in probability, with this suppression getting stronger with lower temperature.
        What we can do, then, is consider the state transitions (i.e. moving to an adjacent lattice point)
        accessible to a given particle, and transition according
        to this probability (staying in the same place is also a valid "transition").
        </p>
        <p>Starting from a randomly filled lattice and a high temperature, we then perform these
        transitions randomly and gradually lower the temperature. With slow cooling, the system
        is likely to end up near its equilibrium (lowest energy) state.
        </p>
        <p>If you're not familiar, it's called "simulated annealing" because it's kind of like
        how a metallurgist anneals a piece of metal. They raise it to high temperatures,
        to encourage atoms to move around, and then slowly cool it down, allowing these moving
        atoms to fill in vacancies and repair defects in crystal structure.
        </p>
        <p>Indeed, over a sufficiently long period of time and a large enough lattice (my periodic
        boundary conditions introduced some irregularities at the edges), the result was many regions
        of the expected honeycomb-like pattern. In between these regions there were messy bits;
        I guess these are like grain boundaries in a real polycrystalline material! Seeing this,
        I went ahead and submitted the exam.
        </p>
        <p>These things were best visualized in my follow-up (more computationally efficient, and well-organized)
        Rust implementation, except I relied on this one random drawing library that seems to not work anymore.
        Someday, I'll come back and fix it, but for now you're welcome to play with the code yourself! The Rust
        version also allows you to define your own lattices and interactions.
