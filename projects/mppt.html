        <p>My janky solar charge controller, built from scavenged parts and designed for 240W, works with a panel in the back yard.

        <p>After my dad's friend who does commercial solar donated a decommissioned panel to me, I decided to take on my first
        electronics project. In my tenure with the <a href="https://www.mitsolar.com">MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team</a>, I'd learned about
        MPPT charge controllers: devices which optimally deliver power from variable sources. This was my goal.</p>
        <p>I built my device around a buck converter, with an Arduino controlling the duty cycle.
        It's able to support constant current, constant voltage, and perturb-and-observe maximum-power (MPPT) output modes,
        making it theoretically suitable for battery charging, but for now it just feeds a constant 15V into some car USB chargers
        to top up my family's devices.</p>
        <p>The whole thing was built using parts pulled off old electronics and assembled on a variety of supports as I was prototyping.
          Notable members: a desoldered PCB where I manually cut traces to get the desired connectivity, and a segment of an electronic dartboard.
          The crown jewel of jankiness: a 2x3mm 5-pin(!) surface-mount differential amplifier for current sensing that I <i>hand-soldered</i> to wires.
          It ain't pretty by any means, <b>but it's been working continuously for 3 years.</b> I do intend for my next project to look nicer. Any ideas?</p>
